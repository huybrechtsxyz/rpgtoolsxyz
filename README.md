# RPG Tools
Role playing game tools and applications from Huybrechts XYZ.

## Campaign Tracker
### Way of Thinking
The RPG campaign and party tracker provides:
- Dashboard with statistics about your campaign and party.
- Played and planned sessions overview
- Quests and pending actions; what did that old hag asked us to do again?
- Wiki sheet to track people and locations of this world
- A ledger that tracks the party's funds
- Items and inventory: all the cool stuff you have or need to find.
- Talent trees and a way to track hero, piety, or talent points
- Kill list. Who killed what when?

### Way of Working
You fill in the sheets with the appropriate information. That's easy!
