Role playing game tools and applications from Huybrechts XYZ.

## Campaign Tracker
### Way of Thinking
The RPG campaign and party tracker provides:
- Dashboard with statistics about your campaign and party.
- Played and planned sessions overview
- Quests and pending actions; what did that old hag asked us to do again?
- Wiki sheet to track people and locations of this world
- An inventory and ledger that tracks the party's funds and cool items
- Fights and encouters aka The Kill List; who killed what when?
- Points (and Talents); track hero points and build a talent tree
- Setup. Update the dropdown lists and some advanced stuff

### Way of Working
You fill in the sheets with the appropriate information. That's easy!
Start by updating the dashboard.
* Update the campaign information and URL's
* Complete the player names

Then update the Wiki with the character and party information
* Creata a line for each character and the party
* Do not forget to update the dashboard with the current characters

At last, during play fill in the information in the respective sheets.

Remark.
Areas that are greyed out or have the text colour blue are calculated; these have formulas, update at your own risk.

That is all. Have fun!
